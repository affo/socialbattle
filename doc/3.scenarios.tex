\chapter{Scenarios Identification}
	In this chapter you will find the most important scenarios among the entire set of possible scenarios that a user could face in interacting with the final application.\\
	I decided to list only the most important, because it happens very often to list scenarios which are self explanatory and so only a waste of time to read and to write.

	I think that the scenarios that needs some clarification are:
	\newcommand{\scenarioLogin}{The Log In}
	\newcommand{\scenarioRooms}{The Rooms}
	\newcommand{\scenarioBattle}{The Battle}
	\newcommand{\scenarioFellowship}{The Fellowship}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \scenarioLogin 
		\item \scenarioRooms 
		\item \scenarioBattle 
		\item \scenarioFellowship
	\end{itemize}

	The main subject of our scenarios will be John. John heard about \textit{Social battle}
	Each scenario will be given a subsection.

	\section{\scenarioLogin}
	\section{\scenarioRooms}
	\section{\scenarioBattle}
	\section{\scenarioFellowship}
