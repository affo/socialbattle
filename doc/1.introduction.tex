	\section{Project Description}
		The project aims at mixing the features of a social network and a role-playing game 
		into a web application named \textit{Social Battle}.

		\noindent If we want to do so, first of all, we have to think of the main features of the two elements:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Social network}\\
			Using a social network we can have a relation with other users and interact with them.\\
			The relation could be a friendship (a symmetric one) or a fellowship (an asymmetric one).\\
			The interaction among (or between) users could be chosen among posts, instant messaging, 
			deferred messaging, votes, comments, tags and others.

			\item \textbf{Role-playing game}\\
			The central idea of a role-playing game is the growth of the character (or the team) we 
			are using, in terms of the level of experience and the equipments and objects in general.\\
			There are a lot of RPGs (especially the one played exclusively on-line) in which there is 
			no other goal than skilling more and more your main character.
		\end{itemize}

		\noindent\textit{Social Battle} will take most of the features of a social network adding the 
		ones of a role-playing game.\\
		If we think of \textit{Facebook} as our landmark for the social networking part, we can 
		better understand what \textit{Social Battle} aims to do.\\
		I will write here the matching between some \textit{Facebook} components and what 
		they might become in \textit{Social Battle} context:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{The page}\\
			Something as a location. A place in which a user can fight mobs.

			\item \textbf{The friendship}\\
			It could become an asymmetric relationship, suck as \textit{Twitter}'s fellowship.
			Once \textit{User A} follows \textit{User B}, he could follow all the progresses
			of \textit{User B};

			\item \textbf{The post}\\
			Could replace loots.

			\item \textbf{The \textit{like}}\\
			The action to grab a loot.

			\item \textbf{Instant messaging}\\
			The fight between a user and a mob (PVE) or between two users (PVP).
		\end{itemize}

		\noindent These were only examples to better understand what \textit{Social Battle} could become.\\
		As you may have already understood, the system will not be provided with a GUI except from the one 
		that usually a social network gives, and so a textual one.
