\chapter{Requirements and Specifications}
	In this chapter the requirements for our web application (the one the end user will use) 
	and for the APIs (that a possible developer will use) will be listed.

	\noindent It is important to say that the requirements that will be listed below, are the 
	theoretical requirements of a \textit{full} application.\\
	I will write a paragraph in which I will specify the minimum functionalities of a working application.

	\noindent So, from the goals written in the previous chapter we can derive our general requirements.\\
	I will write down here, for each goal the requirements that will fulfill it.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\goalSignup}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Provide a sign up functionality (at least with \textit{Facebook}).
				\item Provide a sign up functionality not using an already existent social network.
				\item Provide a sign in functionality.
			\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\goalExplore}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Provide something like a ``location'' in which a player can simply chat with 
				other players and find mobs.
			\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\goalSkill}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Provide the possibility to fight against a spawned mob according to the abilities and 
				skills of the character.\\
				This means that the server shouldn't spawn mobs that have a level too high compared to the one 
				of the player.
				\item Every time a player defeats an enemy the system should reward the player giving him 
				EXP, guils and so on.
				\item Provide a PVP functionality.
			\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\goalFollow}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Provide the possibility to a user to follow another one.
				\item If \textit{User A} follows \textit{User B}, the system should properly notify 
				\textit{User A} about \textit{User B}'s progresses.
			\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\goalProfile}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Provide a ``edit profile'' functionality in terms of the avatar and other personal 
				information. Not about character's skills.
			\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\goalShare}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Provide the possibility to share (using the social network which the user signed in with) his 
				progresses.\\
				This progresses could be defeating a mob, earning guils, earn equips or earn badges.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
